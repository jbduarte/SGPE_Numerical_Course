[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jbduarte/SPGE_Numerical_Course/master)

This course is designed for students interested in learning how to apply numerical methods in Python in order to solve quantitative problems in statistics, finance and economics. This course aims at equipping students with computational tools available in Python and on its main packages: Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. The learning process will be based on hands-on activities. The general approach will be to give a brief theoretical description of the methods followed by examples, whereby students will apply themselves the methods in Python. The course will run for 5 days with 3 hours classes in the morning, and 3 hours classes in the afternoon.
